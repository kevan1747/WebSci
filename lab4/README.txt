I used a few media queries in my CSS file so that my page looks nicely formatted in different
browser sizes. For less drastic size changes, I just changed the width of the left and right
margins of the page so that the twitter ticker stays centered. For small browser sizes, like
mobile size, I decreased the widths and increased the heights of the tweets and hashtags
list items. I also decreased the font size and decreased the margins between list items and
lists. This gave the tweet ticker a more compact style for mobile devices. To get different
browser sizes for testing media queries, I used whatsmy.browsersize.com. I used jQuery
mobile to create a responsive title header that stays centered with any browser width.
